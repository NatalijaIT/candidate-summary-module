# 🍋 Candidate Summary Module

## Dear Lemon.io, Welcome to this page! 

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
A couple of steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
### 2. Create a .env file and set the 'auth-key' which was provided. As an example, you can find .env.example. Also, set the target value (provided base URL) in vite.config.ts.

### 3. Run the command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🛠️ Brief architectural decisions:
I used Vite to bootstrap the project as it's a good and quick out-of-the-box solution for starting projects, fully compatible with React and TypeScript.

I suspect that any mature project uses a design system, so I slightly customized the MUI theme according to the provided designs—added custom colors and styles to reuse throughout the project.

## 🌱 Some details I'd like to share:

This is just a tiny piece of the puzzle, but I had a blast geeking out on best practices and imagining it growing up to be part of something much bigger and cooler!

I know there are a lot of things that can be improved. For the future perspective, I would set prettier or add translation and my styles wish better look, but I'm open to improvements and new skills.

Regards, Nataliia!
